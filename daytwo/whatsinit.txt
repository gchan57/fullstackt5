node -> for backend
express -> a node package that  is convinient than node
FACT : node can be used for a full scale application (but not scalable)
install nodemon , express: npm i nodemon,npm i express
Files:
    -> path.js {path basic};
    -> os.js  {os basic};
    -> main.js {fileoperation basic};
    -> nodeserver {node based derver} -> node nodeserver.js;
    1-> expresssserver.js {express based}                         
    2-> router.js {like abstraction of express for easy calling }
     
    both 1,2 need to be updated in package.json under scripts change the replace file name
    then npm run dev
